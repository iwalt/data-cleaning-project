# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the course project associated with the **[Getting and Cleaning Data]** course from
Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. The motivation for the project is 'to demonstrate
the ability to collect, work with, and clean a dataset'.

## Background

The project relates to a **[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones]** data set which
corresponds to data collected from accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

## Project Requirements

The data that the project uses is that mirrored from the following link:
[Project Data.](
  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

Based on the above data set, a script _run\_analysis.R_ is required that satisfies the
following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the
    average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
